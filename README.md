Note from [dqveha](https://github.com/dqveha):
- I found this project through [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karthikudyawar/disease-symptom-prediction?resource=download&select=Training.csv) to help me start my own AI-powered symptom checker via their dataset. 
- I wanted to play with this locally to confirm my own results, but didn't want to install it into my machine.
- This was a good exercise for me to learn how to use Docker, which I recommend everyone to do if you find a project you want to locally use without a Docker configuration. From this, I've learned the utility behind Docker and will very likely use Docker for every project I work with.
